>* Step3 (Run this step only first time when you start woorking on this project)
>>* If you have python2 as primary<br/>
	`python3 model.py`
>>* If you have python3 as primary<br/>
	`python model.py`

>* Step4 (After running the above step when ever you want to run this project you only have to hit this command after step 1 & step 2)
>>* If you have python2 as primary
